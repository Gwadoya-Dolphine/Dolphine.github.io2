How MY Yummy Recipe App Works

This is a platform that enables one to decide on his/her recipes.
First,when one opens this app the first thing that he/she sees is the landing page.This page is very interactive and impressive in tnat it has a short background video which one can watch as he/she plans to login/sign-up.It also has the sign up and sign in at the top right corner.The it has a login form which is a short cut for login if one has already an account.
One needs to sign up successfully if he/she doesn't have an account the link directs him/her to the register page,then login and finally the login page will direct him/her to the recipes page where she/he can add,edit,view and delete recipes of her/his choice.
The login,register and the recipes page have the back link whereby if clicks on it it takes him/her to the landing page  I can say he/she logs out of the application.
So,this is how this app works.

TOOLS BEHIND IT'S CREATION 
Html
Css
Bootstrap framework.

It is very nice when one has an application like this that he/she can decide on adding,deleting and editing on the recipes and ingredients of his/her choice
