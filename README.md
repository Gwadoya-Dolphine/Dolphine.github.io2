How Doly Yummy Recipe App Works

This is an app that enables one to create,view and edit recipes of his/herchoice.
First,when one opens this app the first thing that he/she sees is the landing page.This page is very interactive and impressive in tnat it has a short background video which one can watch as he/she plans to login/sign-up.

It also has the sign up and sign in at the top right corner.The it has a login form which is a short cut for login if one has already an account.

One needs to sign up successfully if he/she doesn't have an account the link directs him/her to the register page,then login and finally the login page will direct him/her to the recipes page where she/he can add,edit,view and delete recipes of her/his choice.

The login,register and the recipes page have the back link whereby if clicks on it it takes him/her to the landing page  I can say he/she logs out of the application.
